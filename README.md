# JavaScript Functions Overview

This document provides a description and explanation of several JavaScript functions designed for various tasks, including array manipulation, type checking, function throttling, pathfinding in grids, and implementing a timed cache.

## 1. Merge Function

### Description
The `merge` function combines two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, into one sorted array. It modifies `nums1` in place, which initially contains enough space to hold the elements of `nums2`.

### Explanation
- **Parameters**:
  - `nums1`: The first sorted array with extra space for merging.
  - `m`: The number of valid elements in `nums1`.
  - `nums2`: The second sorted array.
  - `n`: The number of valid elements in `nums2`.
- The function starts merging from the end of both arrays to prevent overwriting elements in `nums1`.
- It uses three pointers:
  - `p1` for the last valid element in `nums1`.
  - `p2` for the last valid element in `nums2`.
  - `p` for the last position in `nums1`.
- The merging process continues until all elements from both arrays are compared and placed in their correct positions.

## 2. Last Element Function

### Description
This function extends the `Array` prototype to include a method that retrieves the last element of an array.

### Explanation
- If the array is empty, it returns `-1`.
- Otherwise, it returns the last element, allowing for easy access to the last value in any array.

## 3. Instance Of Function

### Description
The `isInstanceOf` function checks whether a given value is an instance of a specified class constructor.

### Explanation
- **Parameters**:
  - `value`: The value to be checked.
  - `classConstructor`: The class constructor to check against.
- It handles undefined values and ensures the second parameter is a valid function (class).
- The function uses the `instanceof` operator to determine if the value is an instance of the specified class or its superclass.

## 4. Debounce Function

### Description
The `debounce` function creates a debounced version of a given function, limiting how often it can be invoked.

### Explanation
- **Parameters**:
  - `func`: The function to debounce.
  - `delay`: The time (in milliseconds) to wait before invoking the function after the last call.
- It uses a timeout to delay the execution of the function, ensuring it only runs after the specified delay has passed since the last invocation.

## 5. Max Moves Function

### Description
The `maxMoves` function calculates the maximum number of moves possible in a grid based on specific movement rules.

### Explanation
- **Parameters**:
  - `grid`: A 2D array representing the grid where each cell contains a number.
- It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum moves from each cell, considering valid upward, rightward, and downward movements.
- The function iterates over the grid from the second last column to the first, updating the maximum possible moves based on neighboring cells.

## 6. Timed Cache Class

### Description
The `TimedCache` class implements a cache with expiration functionality, allowing storage and retrieval of values that expire after a specified duration.

### Explanation
- **Methods**:
  - `set(key, value, duration)`: Stores a value with a specified expiration time. It returns `true` if the key already existed and was updated, or `false` if it was newly created.
  - `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the key if it has not expired; otherwise, it returns `-1`.
  - `count()`: Returns the count of unexpired keys in the cache, automatically removing expired entries.
- The cache uses a `Map` to store entries with their corresponding expiration times.
